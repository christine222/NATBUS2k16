# NATBUS2k16
ops natbus 2016 capstone project
By Christine Chen, Allison Doami, and Charlotte McGinn

This is the final capstone project to complete as part of the curriculum for UCLA IEEE OPS, an intrduction program to
designing electrical engineering projects. Our team decided to complete the "Natbus" for our capstone project, which is 
an autonomous car, controlled by a Teensy LC microcontroller, that follows a line. We designed PCBs using Eagle PCB Design
Software to create our light proximity sensors that detect the line to follow. This project spanned from March - May 2016
and utilized all of the concepts we had learned throughout the year in OPS and prepared us to take on more advanced projects
in UCLA IEEE in future years.
