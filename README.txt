# NATBUS2k16
ops natbus 2016 capstone project
By Christine Chen, Allison Doami, and Charlotte McGinn

This is the final capstone project to complete as part of the curriculum for UCLA IEEE OPS, an introductory program to electrical engineering project design. Our team decided to complete the "Natbus" for our capstone project, which is an autonomous car that follows a line, controlled by a Teensy LC microcontroller. We utilized PID control in order to minimize our oscillations when following the course. We also designed PCBs using Eagle PCB Design Software to create our light proximity sensors that detect the line to follow. This project spanned from March - May 2016 and utilized all of the concepts we had learned throughout the year in OPS and prepared us to take on more advanced projects in UCLA IEEE in future years.
